# HousePrices-ML
Prediction of housing prices using Machine Learning

> In this project we explore a housing pricing dataset using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `dython`. After that, we will prepare the dataset for model training, after that we will consider four different ML models using `sklearn` and `xgboost` libraries, and then assess the performance of each model using cross validation. Ultimately, we will choose the best ML model, select the best parameters for this model using `GridSearchCV`, and apply the model on the test dataset to predict the housing prices in Boston.
